## What the fck is this?
After I took some React course, I found I spent most of time on syntax. So it is time to step back to some basic JS and Web dev knowledge.

## Why do you pay for this?
Through his discription, I can see this guy, Kyle Cook, knew a lot of typical problem that could happend on learner. That is the reason why I would like to have a try.

## Why don't you get through free self study materials?
# I don't think it is a shame for paying for knowledge or reflect you have weaker ability than other, especially if one could get some shortcut and avoid waste of time. Every problem can be solved only by money is a good problem. That is it.

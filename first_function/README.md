## What did you get?
1. a function pass to another function is called "Call back"
2. The function is also a kind of variables, this is functionality programmming
3. function can be implemented directly into another function call, as a parameter
4. single parameter and single line return can use shortcut in arrow function, like let printHi = name => "Hi " + name
5. hoisting, hoisting is you can call a function before difined(sequence doesn't matter). But it doesn't work on arrow function. Arrow function is difined as a variable.
6. scopping, If a variable was not found in local scope (in the function), it will automaticly search in the outer scope(Script). Inner scope can search outter scope, but outter can not seach inner
7. some closure tricks, see code's comments
